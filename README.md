# Time-Series
This repository contains various mini-projects related to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting. Each project explores different techniques and models used in time series data analysis, including preprocessing, visualization, trend analysis, and forecasting.
#""Mini Project 1: Air Passengers Time Series Analysis""#
In this project, we analyze the Air Passengers dataset, which contains monthly statistics of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The goal is to explore the trends, seasonality, and patterns in air travel over time using time series analysis techniques.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Convert the Month column to a datetime object and set it as the index.
Sort the data chronologically to prepare for time series analysis.
Visualization:

We create Matplotlib line charts for static visualizations.
Interactive time series charts are built using Plotly, allowing us to explore the data more interactively.
Key Insights:

By visualizing the number of passengers over time, we can identify seasonal trends and significant growth over the years.
This project lays the groundwork for more advanced time series forecasting and anomaly detection in future mini-projects.
Outcome:
This project serves as a foundational example of time series analysis, demonstrating data preprocessing and visualization techniques that can be applied to various time series datasets.
